With the rise of urban populations and increasing safety concerns, surveillance systems have become a key part of modern security infrastructure. Cameras are now installed in public spaces like streets, shopping malls, schools, airports, and train stations to keep an eye on activities and ensure safety. These cameras collect large amounts of video data every day.

Although these systems are useful, there is a major problem: most of the video footage goes unwatched unless something goes wrong. Manually checking hours of video is not only tiring but also slow and inefficient. To make these systems smarter and more useful, there is a growing interest in developing automatic methods that can detect and track people in real-time.

However, building such systems is not easy. Real-world videos often have problems like poor lighting, low video quality, crowded scenes, and people walking in and out of the cameraâ€™s view. These challenges make it hard for traditional detection and tracking methods to work well.

This has led to the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning in the field of video surveillance. Deep learning models have shown great promise in detecting people and tracking their movement in real-time. These models can help build automatic systems that are faster, more reliable, and more accurate than older methods.

In this project, we explore the use of modern AI techniques to track a specific person across one or more surveillance videos. The main goal is to create a system that can work well even in tough conditions like low light, crowded places, or when the person leaves and re-enters the frame. This kind of system can be very useful for improving safety and security in both public and private areas.
